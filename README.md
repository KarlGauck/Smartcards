# Smartcards
Smartcards is an obsidian-plugin that uses [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs?hl=de) or [Ollama](https://ollama.com) generate (text-based) flashcards from notes inside your vault.

You can leave hints inside your note to specify exactly, which information should be converted into cards, how your card should be structured content-wise etc.

You can specify, what text-format should be used and where the notes with the flashcards should be stored. You could, for example,
specify the format of [Anki Bridge](https://jeppeklitgaard.github.io/ObsidianAnkiBridge/) flashcards and sync them with [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) afterwards.

### Unfinished Features
- Ollama support (works but is not yet accessible to the user)
- Fancy stuff such as selecting from different possible cards, refining cards etc
